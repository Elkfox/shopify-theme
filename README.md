# shopify-theme

Elkfox's 'Shopify Theme' is a series of tools and assets for extending Shopify theme builds. 'Shopify Theme' superceeds the 'Concrete Theme Framework' and its precursor, the original 'Shopify Theme Framework'.

Tools can be cherrypicked as needed.

## Getting started

'Shopify Theme' is designed to be used with Slate, but could just as easily also be used with other NPM based workflows.

We recommend using Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add @elkfox/shopify-theme
```
